HW#1 for MCON152 Computer Methodology - Cohen

My name is Eliezer Meth.  I am a computer science student, currently enrolled in my third and final year of the program to receive a Master's degree.

This repository was created from the requirements of the first homework of MCON 152, Computer Methodology, taught by Michael J Cohen.
